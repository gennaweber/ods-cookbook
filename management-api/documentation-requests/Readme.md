## Requests from the API Documentation

*_WARNING : This collection is not a feature of Opendatasoft and is only a experimental tool that allows you to work efficiently with the Beta API Management in a graphical interface._*

**This collection aims at translating as many example requests as possible from the ODS documentation into Postman**. Exhaustivity should be the target.

Its organization follows the one of the documentation website: [https://betahelp.opendatasoft.com/management-api/#introduction](https://betahelp.opendatasoft.com/management-api/#introduction) .

All variables (such as apikey, datasetid, datasetuid, etc.) should be stored in a Postman environement.
