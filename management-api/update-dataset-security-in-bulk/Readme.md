# Edit the security of your datasets in bulk

*WARNING : This collection is not a feature of Opendatasoft and is only a experimental tool that allows you to work efficiently with the Beta API Management in a graphical interface.*

This Postman collection is designed to help you edit security rules in bulk by sending the resquets for UID fetch, for security changes and for publishing all at once. If a group listed in your datafile does not exist, it is created on your domain.

You can download the collection here : [Dataset security - Update user and groups permissions at once](https://github.com/opendatasoft/ods-cookbook/blob/master/management-api/update-dataset-security-in-bulk/20210402%20-%20Dataset%20security%20-%20Update%20user%20and%20groups%20permissions%20at%20once.postman_collection.json). Please read the description of the collection in Postman before running it.
